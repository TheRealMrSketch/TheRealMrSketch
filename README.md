- 👋 Hi, I’m @TheRealMrSketch. You can call me Sketch if you don't have much time, or Dan if you have VERY LITTLE time.
- 👀 I’m interested in game design using GameMaker. Not nessesarily for earning a living, although I would like to work up to that in the future, I want to build because I want to appreciate one of my own creations born from my ideas.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C, and HTML since I started my Electronics Engineering Technology Diploma at Okanagan College. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with people who are working on video game projects using the GM software. I would be willing to help but I'm not a master at the program yet.
- 📫 How to reach me: You can add me on Discord, "therealmrsketch". My email is for personal use and College.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I like to play some piano, and I do Wing Chun Kung Fu.
I seem to have an overwhelming fascination for Math and Physics, even if I'm not good at all of it. I'm also good at drawing 3D pictures whenever I want.
